Machine Learning classification for breast cancer recognition

One of the most prevalent malignancies in both men and women is breast cancer. Breast cells begin to develop improperly, which is how breast cancer develops. Numerous people pass away each year as a result of this malignancy. It is the most prevalent form of cancer and the leading killer of women worldwide.

Data classification techniques such as data mining are quite effective today. Particularly when discussing the medical industry, where we utilise machine learning to diagnose diseases and conduct analyses in order to reach certain judgments.

So with the help of Machine learning if we can classify the patient having which type of cancer, then it will be easy for doctors to provide timely treatment to patients and improve the chance of survival.

Using a neural network, we easily constructed a project for classifying breast cancer. On training data, our model's accuracy is 98.8%, and on validation data, it's 97.9%. Our model is identifying test data quite effectively and precisely, as we have already witnessed.
